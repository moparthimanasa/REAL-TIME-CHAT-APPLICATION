# Description

This is a **Mern-stack real-time chat application** built using **React** for the frontend and **Node.js with Socket.IO** for the backend. The application allows users to send and receive messages instantly, demonstrating the use of WebSocket technology for live communication.The frontend offers a responsive interface built with React components, while the backend handles message broadcasting using Express and Socket.IO.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time messaging using Socket.IO
- Simple, intuitive React-based UI
- Backend server built with Node.js and Express
- Easy to run locally
- Lightweight and fast


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS for styling

### Backend:
- Node.js
- Express
- Socket.IO


## 📁 Folder Structure

The project is divided into two main directories: `client` and `server`.

### `client/`

This is the frontend part of the application.

- `public/` - Contains the HTML template.
  - index.html
  - favicon.ico
- `src/` - All React components and styles.
  - `App.js` - Main React component.
  - `index.js` - Entry point of the React app.
  - `App.css` / `index.css` - Styling.
  - App.test.js
  - logo.svg   -for logo
- `package.json` - Contains project dependencies and scripts.

### `server/`

This contains the backend code.

- `index.js` - Sets up the Express server and handles Socket.IO logic.
- `package.json` - Dependencies for the backend.


## ⚙️ Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites:

- Node.js installed
- npm or yarn package manager
 
### 1. Clone the Repository


git clone https://github.com/moparthimanasa/REAL-TIME-CHAT-APPLICATION.git

### Backend Setup (Node.js + Socket.IO)

cd server

npm install     # Install backend dependencies

node index.js   # Start the backend server

#  Frontend Setup (React)

cd client

npm install     # Install frontend dependencies

npm start       # Start the React development server

The frontend will start on: http://localhost:3000

# ✅ Test the App

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Open another tab or window to simulate a second user.

Start chatting in real-time!

# 💬 How It Works

When a user sends a message through the React frontend, it emits a chat message event via Socket.IO.

The Node.js server listens for this event and broadcasts the message to all connected clients.

All clients receive the message in real-time and display it in the chat window.

# 🧹 Best Practices Followed

Component-based architecture in React

Clean and maintainable code

Separation of frontend and backend

Use of WebSocket best practices

# ❓ Troubleshooting

Ensure both the server and client are running on their respective ports.

Check that your browser allows WebSocket connections.

Ensure that your Node.js and npm versions are up to date.

# ✅ Future Enhancements

User authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth)

Persistent chat storage using a database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)

Typing indicators

Private messaging or chat rooms

User online/offline status

# Output
